# Custom Automation and Monitoring ‚öôÔ∏èüìä

This section contains custom scripts developed to automate tasks, monitor system health, or facilitate management within the T-Pot honeypot and server environment. In security-focused deployments like honeypots, especially when co-hosted with other services, automation and proactive monitoring are essential for maintaining stability, ensuring continuous data collection, and quickly identifying potential issues before they impact operations.

Each subdirectory focuses on a specific script or tool, providing the source code and relevant documentation. These tools were born out of necessity to troubleshoot complex issues and reduce manual intervention, ultimately providing consistent visibility into system health for more efficient management.

**Currently includes:**

*   `T-Pot_Monitoring_Script/`: ü©∫ A comprehensive Bash script for monitoring T-Pot honeypot status and system health. This tool proved invaluable for diagnosing intermittent container failures, resource constraints, and configuration conflicts affecting honeypot data collection.
