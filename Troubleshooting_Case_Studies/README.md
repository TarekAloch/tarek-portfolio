# Troubleshooting & Problem Solving Case Studies üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîß

## Overview

This section presents detailed case studies of specific technical challenges encountered during the setup, configuration, and maintenance of the project environment. Documenting these processes highlights the practical application of systematic troubleshooting methodologies to resolve complex, real-world issues.

## Environment Context

All documented case studies occurred within the primary project environment: an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) ARM-based virtual machine running Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS. This server co-hosts a T-Pot Community Edition honeypot stack alongside various containerized services (managed via Docker/Portainer) and Nginx, presenting unique integration and configuration challenges.

## Case Study Format

Each study follows a structured format:

1.  **Problem Statement:** Describes the issue encountered.
2.  **Investigation & Evolution:** Details the steps taken to diagnose the root cause and outlines any iterative solution attempts.
3.  **Implemented Solution:** Explains the specific actions and configurations that resolved the problem.
4.  **Lessons Learned:** Summarizes key takeaways and insights gained.

## Featured Case Study

*   **[1_CaseStudy_Secure_Multiplexed_Access_via_SSH_Config.md](./1_CaseStudy_Secure_Multiplexed_Access_via_SSH_Config.md):** üîê Chronicles the evolution from cumbersome command-line port forwarding to an elegant and secure solution using the client-side `~/.ssh/config` file (`LocalForward`) to provide multiplexed access to multiple internal services through a single, hardened SSH entry point. Demonstrates advanced SSH configuration, security architecture thinking, and usability improvements.

*(Note: A detailed case study on the specific data sanitization challenges for the Attack Map can be found within the [Honeypot Project's Data Sanitization Subproject](../Honeypot_Project_T-Pot_CE/4_Data_Sanitization_Subproject/CaseStudy_Attack_Map_Data_Sanitization.md).)*

*(More case studies documenting other challenges, such as DNS resolution and container management issues, will be added as they are finalized.)*
