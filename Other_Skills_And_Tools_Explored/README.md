# Extended Server Capabilities & Monitoring üõ†Ô∏èüí°

## Overview

This section documents additional relevant technologies, tools, and skills that were implemented or explored on the server environment beyond the core T-Pot honeypot deployment. **To gain deeper visibility into system performance and explore alternative management interfaces alongside the core honeypot project, several additional tools were installed, configured, and evaluated.** The notes below are synthesized from session logs documenting the setup and troubleshooting process (`geminichanges4182020.md`).

## Implemented System Management & Monitoring Tools

*   **Cockpit:** üñ•Ô∏è Integrated Cockpit for streamlined web-based server management. Required troubleshooting and resolving initial XRDP/TLS connectivity issues and configuring Polkit rules to grant necessary runtime permissions for administrative tasks like package management via the web UI. Fixed Python dependency errors affecting `cockpit-packagekit`.
*   **Grafana:** üìä Successfully deployed Grafana via Docker and engineered network connectivity across separate Docker stacks, enabling visualization of data queried directly from T-Pot's internal Elasticsearch instance (configured as a data source).
*   **Prometheus & Node-Exporter:** üìà Implemented the Prometheus & Node-Exporter monitoring stack via Docker for granular host and container metrics collection. This included configuring Prometheus service discovery to scrape Node-Exporter targets and securing Prometheus UI access via SSH tunneling.

## Key Configuration & Troubleshooting Areas Addressed

*   **Docker Networking:** ‚ÜîÔ∏è Diagnosed and resolved cross-stack connectivity issues, specifically enabling Grafana (in its own stack) to securely access the Elasticsearch service within the T-Pot Docker network (`tpotce_nginx_local`).
*   **Nginx Analysis:** ‚úîÔ∏è Reviewed and validated existing System Nginx configurations for correctness in handling T-Pot components, Cloudflare integration, and virtual host routing.
*   **NTP Configuration:** üïí Analyzed and confirmed the host's Network Time Protocol setup utilized recommended OCI NTP sources for accurate system-wide time synchronization, crucial for correlating logs.
*   **XRDP & TLS:** üîê Troubleshot and resolved initial connection problems with XRDP related to user permissions and TLS certificate handling during setup attempts.
*   **System Permissions (Polkit):** üîë Researched and applied Polkit rules (`pkla`) to grant specific, necessary runtime privileges for Cockpit actions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

## Researched Concepts & Future Enhancements

Beyond the tools implemented above, further research and conceptual planning occurred regarding:

*   **Advanced Server Hardening:** Investigated techniques including automated intrusion blocking (`fail2ban`), system call auditing (`auditd`), file integrity monitoring (`AIDE`), endpoint scanning (`ClamAV`, `rkhunter`), and kernel tuning (`sysctl`) for enhanced security posture.
*   **Advanced Cybersecurity Projects:** Conceptualized leveraging T-Pot data for dynamic threat intelligence enrichment, developing custom honeypots, simulating attack sequences (Scapy/tcpreplay), and building correlated event alerting systems (ElastAlert 2/Grafana Alerting).
*   **Configuration Management & Best Practices:** Acknowledged the value of infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) and configuration management (Ansible) for future scalability and repeatability, alongside robust documentation and version control (Git) practices.

## Future Directions

The successful integration of these supporting tools demonstrates a commitment to building well-managed and observable systems. Future work could focus on:

1.  Implementing select advanced server hardening techniques.
2.  Developing proof-of-concept cybersecurity projects based on the research.
3.  Migrating suitable configurations to Ansible for automated management.
4.  Creating dedicated Grafana dashboards pulling data from both Prometheus and the T-Pot Elasticsearch instance for a unified monitoring view.

This continuous exploration ensures the technical skillset remains current with modern operational and security practices.
