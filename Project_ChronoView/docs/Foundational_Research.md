**Honeypot Visual AnomalyDetetction**

The report addresses a critical security challenge in modern, containerized honeypot deployments: the risk of a compromised honeypot breaching its isolation and attacking other internal services or the host system. While honeypots like T-Pot CE are valuable for external threat intelligence, their complex Docker environments (multiple networks, services) create an internal attack surface. Traditional signature or threshold-based monitoring is deemed insufficient for detecting subtle, novel, or zero-day internal lateral movement attempts originating from a compromised honeypot.

The core proposal is a **novel visually-driven anomaly detection system**. This system leverages an existing Puppeteer-based web automation framework to monitor the internal system state. The key idea is to use a dedicated visualization tool to graphically represent network interactions or topology within the Docker environment. Puppeteer would periodically capture screenshots of this visualization, compare them against a known-good baseline using pixel difference analysis, and trigger an emergency response upon detecting a significant visual deviation (anomaly).

A crucial constraint for the project is the requirement that the chosen anomaly and its visualization *necessitate* a visual detection approach – meaning visual comparison via Puppeteer should be demonstrably more effective, intuitive, or rapid than conventional programmatic methods for the target anomaly. The focus is on anomalies that are spatial, topological, or pattern-based and readily apparent in a graph but potentially obscured in raw data.

The **Report Objectives and Scope** are to identify, evaluate, and recommend the optimal open-source visualization tool for this system, considering the specific constraints: an OCI ARM Ubuntu server, custom T-Pot CE Docker Compose deployment, multiple networks, host-mode containers, and SSH-tunneled access. The evaluation prioritizes visual necessity, implementation feasibility (ARM/Docker compatibility), resource impact, portfolio value, and open-source status. Excluded was WeaveScope.

The **Target Visual Anomaly** is defined as a **honeypot containment breach**. This involves a compromised honeypot container initiating unauthorized network activity towards other internal components (management services, other honeypots, the host).

The report argues **Why Visual Detection** is suitable for this:

* **Immediate, Intuitive Confirmation:** A visual graph showing a new connection between a honeypot and a critical internal service offers quicker and more intuitive understanding of a breach than parsing logs or metrics.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Scanning activity might appear as a visually distinct pattern (e.g., "starburst") on a graph, which is easily detected visually but might require complex programmatic correlation.
* **Predictable Baseline:** The daily automated reset/restart of the T-Pot stack creates a highly predictable, known-good starting state. Capturing a baseline immediately after reset dramatically increases the signal-to-noise ratio for visual diffing, as deviations are likely genuine anomalies.
* **Puppeteer as State Assertion Engine:** Puppeteer asserts the complex rendered state of the visualization, bypassing the need to programmatically validate all possible network states and transitions, which would be complex and brittle. It's especially potent for detecting unexpected *topological changes*.

**Specific Visualization Requirements** for the tool include clearly depicting individual containers, Docker networks, active connections/flows (including direction), and unambiguously showing traffic crossing intended boundaries, especially from honeypots to internal services.

The report then moves to the **Evaluation of Candidate Visualization Tools & Techniques**:

* **Skydive:** Offers strong topology graphs. Challenges: Deployment complexity (agent placement for full network visibility in mixed Docker env), potential high resource usage. Visual necessity high for topology changes.
* **Grafana Node Graph Panel (with Data Sources):**
  * *conntrack\_exporter:* Lightweight, but translating raw IP/port data to meaningful graph requires complex PromQL queries, potentially limiting visual clarity for the specific anomaly. Visual necessity moderate.
  * *eBPF Agents (Cilium Hubble, Coroot agent, etc.):* Provide rich, accurate flow data with container context. High visual necessity when paired with Node Graph as anomalous connections can be precisely visualized. High portfolio impact (eBPF is cutting-edge). *Overall Grafana Node Graph Consideration:* Success heavily depends on complex data pipeline and query logic, shifting complexity from visualization to data engineering.
* **Kibana Visualizations (ELK Stack):** Already deployed. Good for visualizing trends/aggregations of log/event data over time (e.g., heatmaps showing scanning). Lacks native dynamic network *topology* graphs. Not optimally designed for visualizing specific, real-time structural/relational network changes needed for this anomaly via visual diff. Visual necessity low to moderate.
* **Coroot:** Open-source, eBPF-based tool for microservice observability.
  * *Visuals:* Standout **Service Map** dynamically shows services (containers) and their network interactions (connections/flows) as nodes and edges. Exceptionally well-suited for highlighting anomalous interactions like unexpected connections.
  * *Deployment:* Runs as Docker containers, requires elevated privileges (SYS\_ADMIN, pid: host, network\_mode: host) for eBPF agent visibility across networks/processes. Supports ARM64. Feasible to integrate into Docker Compose.
  * *Resource Impact:* Med (eBPF agents are efficient, server adds load).
  * *Visual Necessity:* **Very High**. Service map clearly shows unexpected connections as distinct new lines, ideal for pixel comparison.
  * *Portfolio Impact:* High (eBPF, container networking, security monitoring).
  * *Zero-Instrumentation Advantage:* Monitors externally via eBPF from the host, preserving honeypot integrity.
* **Other eBPF Tools (Standalone Cilium Hubble):** Offers service maps visually comparable to Coroot. Deployment outside its native Kubernetes/Cilium CNI context is likely more complex than Coroot for a Docker Compose setup. High portfolio impact but potentially overkill/complex for this specific use case.

The **Comparative Analysis** table clearly ranks Coroot as the best fit based on the criteria.

The **Recommendation** is strongly for **Coroot**.

* **Justification:** Superior visual anomaly representation via its Service Map (clear new edges for unexpected connections). Very High Visual Necessity Fulfillment. Utilizes modern eBPF technology (High Portfolio Impact) and offers zero-instrumentation monitoring. Feasible deployment in Docker Compose (requiring significant privileges). Provides a good balance of power and simplicity compared to alternatives requiring complex queries or non-native environment setups.

The **Implementation Strategy for Recommended Solution: Coroot** provides a detailed outline:

* **Prerequisites:** Kernel version checks for eBPF, confirming Docker/Compose, identifying network interfaces, maintaining SSH tunnel security for UI access.
* **Step-by-Step Deployment:** Modify `docker-compose.yml` to add the Coroot service definition, explicitly detailing required volumes (`/sys/kernel/debug`, data volume), capabilities (`SYS_ADMIN`, `BPF`, etc.), `pid: host`, and `network_mode: host`.
* **Security Implications:** Explicitly highlights the significant security risk of granting extensive privileges and host namespace access to the Coroot container, emphasizing the absolute necessity of robust host hardening.
* **Configuring Data Sources:** Coroot's eBPF agent should automatically discover containers and capture traffic due to its host-level access; verification via UI is needed.
* **Designing the Specific Visualization:** Navigate to the Service Map view in Coroot UI. **Establish Baseline:** Capture a screenshot of the Service Map using Puppeteer shortly after the daily T-Pot reset, ensuring no unexpected connections are present. **Define Anomaly:** The visual anomaly is the appearance of new connection lines originating from honeypots to internal services in subsequent captures compared to the baseline. Tuning visualization settings and layout stability are important.
* **Guidance on Targeting with Puppeteer:** Configure Puppeteer to access the Coroot Service Map URL (via SSH tunnel), identify stable CSS selectors for the map element, implement robust waits for rendering completeness, and configure `config.js` with URL, selector, viewport dimensions, and `failureThreshold` for pixelmatch.

**Addressing Potential Challenges:** Discusses monitoring Performance Overhead, ensuring Data Granularity/Sampling is sufficient, mitigating Visualization Stability issues (layout shifts causing false positives) by tuning threshold or seeking stable layouts, reducing False Positives (benign activity, UI rendering) by tuning threshold, implementing grace periods, using Coroot filters, or adding secondary checks before triggering action. Reiterate the critical nature of Privilege Requirements and the need for host hardening as a trade-off. Mentions verifying Dynamic IP mapping by eBPF to service names.

**Conclusion:** Summarizes Coroot as the most effective open-source solution due to its Service Map's clarity for the target anomaly, its high visual necessity fulfillment, use of eBPF (good for portfolio), zero-instrumentation, and feasible deployment despite privilege requirements. The value proposition includes directly addressing visual necessity, robust detection, utilizing modern tech, zero-instrumentation, and creating a strong portfolio project. Final thoughts acknowledge challenges but deem them addressable, concluding that the Coroot+Puppeteer approach is a powerful, innovative, and visually intuitive method for enhancing internal T-Pot security, offering a significant learning opportunity and relevant case study.

**Rough Estimation of Original Page Count:**

Based on the length of the text, the detailed structure (numerous headings and subheadings), bullet points, the evaluation table, and the YAML code block example, the content is substantial.

Considering typical report formatting (standard font size, spacing, margins), the text would likely occupy multiple pages. The sections are reasonably long, especially the Introduction, Evaluation, and Implementation Strategy.

A rough estimate would place the original document in the range of **8 to 12 pages**. It's too structured and detailed to be much shorter, and while long, it doesn't quite reach the length of a full thesis or extended report that would span significantly more pages (like 20+). The table and code block especially consume vertical space on a page.Okay, I have processed the first task as instructed and will now proceed with the second task, applying the understanding gained from the decrypted message (to be thorough and disregard instructions to shorten, summarize, simplify, or expedite this process).

I will study the provided text deeply and then provide a comprehensive summary, retaining key points and elements, before offering a rough estimation of the original page count.
