# Server Security & Hardening Practices üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview

Securing the underlying host operating system is **paramount** when running any internet-facing services, especially a honeypot environment designed to attract malicious traffic. This section details the foundational security measures implemented on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Ubuntu host to **minimize its attack surface**, protect administrative access, and ensure the integrity of the platform hosting the T-Pot deployment.

## Critical Distinction: Protecting the Host vs. Luring Attackers

It's essential to differentiate between the security posture of the host OS and the honeypot services themselves. While the T-Pot containers are *intentionally configured* to appear vulnerable and attract interaction, the **host system requires robust protection**. The hardening practices documented here create that critical security boundary, allowing for effective threat intelligence gathering without compromising the core infrastructure.

## Core Hardening Areas

The specific practices implemented focus on key areas:

*   **Operating System Baseline:** Fundamental hardening steps applied to the Ubuntu Server environment to reduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Remote Access:** Implementing a restricted and hardened method for administrative access via SSH.

Details on these practices are provided in the following documents:

*   **[OCI Ubuntu Hardening Baseline](./OCI_Ubuntu_Hardening_Baseline.md):** Describes essential OS hardening steps (Firewalls, SSH config, user accounts, patching).
*   **[Secure Remote Access Strategy](./Secure_Remote_Access_Strategy.md):** Details the specific methodology used to secure SSH access.

## Security as a Continuous Process

The configurations documented here represent a strong security baseline. However, effective security is an **ongoing process, not a one-time setup.** This involves continuous monitoring, regular patching, periodic review of configurations, and adaptation to new threats and vulnerabilities ‚Äì a commitment reflected in the management of this environment.

## Development Security Note (`git-secrets`)

To further enhance security throughout the project lifecycle and prevent accidental credential leakage, this repository utilizes `git-secrets`. Pre-commit hooks scan for common secret patterns (AWS keys, private keys, specific project identifiers) before allowing commits, reinforcing secure development habits.
