* **Web Server / Proxy:** Nginx configuration (reverse proxy, virtual hosts, TLS/SSL setup, security headers, location blocks).
* **Scripting & Automation:**
  * Bash shell scripting (automation, monitoring).
  * Python (data processing, basic API interaction - demonstrated in sanitization script).
  * **Node.js (Web Test Automation via Puppeteer).**
* **Testing & QA Concepts:**
  * **Visual Regression Testing.**
  * **Web Performance Monitoring & Metrics Collection.**
  * **Animation Capture & Comparison.**
* **Troubleshooting:** Systematic diagnosis and resolution of complex, multi-layered issues involving OS, networking, containerization, and application conflicts. *(See Case Studies section)*.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) VM instance deployment and management, network security groups.

## Featured Project: T-Pot CE Honeypot Co-Hosting & Customization üçØüõ°Ô∏è

This project details the deployment and management of a complex T-Pot CE honeypot environment. **A key challenge addressed was successfully co-hosting the multi-container T-Pot stack alongside existing production web services on a single OCI ARM instance.** Overcoming this required:

* Developing custom **Nginx reverse proxy routing strategies** to logically separate honeypot traffic from legitimate web traffic.
* Implementing advanced **firewall rule management** (`iptables` via `systemd`) to prevent T-Pot's dynamic blocking from interfering with essential administrative access.
* Engineering a **server-side data sanitization solution** (Python modification) to securely expose the live Attack Map visualization via Cloudflare Tunnel.
* Establishing a **secure and scalable method for accessing internal management tools** (like Kibana, Portainer, etc.) using the SSH Tunneling strategy detailed in the [Secure Access Case Study](./Troubleshooting_Case_Studies/1_CaseStudy_Secure_Multiplexed_Access_via_SSH_Config.md).

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in threat intelligence gathering, system integration, secure configuration, and complex problem-solving.

## T-Pot Honeypot Visualization üìäüåç

## Troubleshooting & Problem Solving Case Studies üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîß

Effective troubleshooting is critical in IT. Documenting challenges and their resolutions can help others uncover key bugs and make significant breakthroughs. This section contains detailed case studies showcasing the investigation and resolution of significant technical challenges encountered.

A particularly complex challenge involved **securing the public Attack Map by implementing server-side data sanitization**; the full investigation is detailed within the T-Pot project section below.

## Custom Automation & Monitoring ‚öôÔ∏è

To improve environment stability and visibility, custom tooling was developed. This section features a comprehensive, **configuration-agnostic Bash script** created specifically for **deep health monitoring** of the T-Pot deployment. It dynamically detects services and performs checks beyond basic uptime, including log analysis, resource usage, network accessibility, and complex firewall rule validation.

**‚û°Ô∏è [See Automation & Monitoring Scripts](./Custom_Automation_And_Monitoring/)**

## Visual Web Testing & Anomaly Detection Framework (Project ChronoView) üì∏

Developed a comprehensive testing framework using Node.js and Puppeteer, initially designed for visual validation, animation comparison, and performance benchmarking. This framework evolved into **Project ChronoView**, a specific application focused on security monitoring within the unique context of the co-hosted T-Pot environment.

* **Core Function (ChronoView):** Leverages Puppeteer to periodically capture screenshots of the **Coroot Service Map** (visualizing internal container network traffic via eBPF). It then performs pixel-based comparisons (`pixelmatch`) against a known-good baseline image to detect unexpected topological changes, specifically targeting potential **honeypot containment breaches** (e.g., a honeypot container attempting connections to internal management services).
* **Motivation:** Addresses the inherent risk of co-hosting T-Pot by providing a mechanism for monitoring internal lateral movement attempts that might bypass traditional logging, especially relevant given the localhost-bound nature of other services accessible only via secure SSH tunnels.
* **Key Features:** Automated checks via `cron`, fixed baseline comparison with `--update-baseline` capability, detailed individual HTML reports showing visual differences, and a historical dashboard (`report.html`) visualizing diff percentage trends over time.
* **Approach:** Explores visual state assertion as a novel, complementary monitoring technique. While programmatic checks for specific connections are possible, this approach leverages visual intuition for anomaly detection and demonstrates the ability to build complex visual assertion engines. It benefits from Coroot's **zero-instrumentation monitoring** via eBPF, ensuring honeypot integrity.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Node.js, Puppeteer automation, JavaScript (ES6+ Async/Await), testing methodologies, configuration management, Coroot/eBPF integration understanding, `pixelmatch` visual comparison, security monitoring concepts, complex system integration, troubleshooting (documented in detail within the project).
